=========

Displays 1D cellular automata progress.
Currently it displays only the shape resulting from applying rule 30 on a world with a single set cell in the middle. Progressing can be done by stepping. Final shape is obtained by "playing".

Things to be done:
------------------
- Adding an input for rule number
- More flexible play options (e.g. time spacing)
- Support for individual cells toggling
- 2D worlds
